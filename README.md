## Hi there 👋 I'm Prem Swaroopa Nanda Ramalingam

I'm a Computer Science graduate student and former Software Engineer with hands-on
experience building **data-intensive systems, scalable ETL pipelines, and AI-driven
applications**. I enjoy designing robust architectures, optimizing performance,
and translating complex data problems into reliable engineering solutions.

Currently pursuing my **MS in Computer Science** while building projects at the
intersection of **Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Backend Systems**.


## 🚀 Expertise

I specialize in designing and implementing **scalable data pipelines and intelligent
systems** that support real-world analytics and decision-making.

Previously at **HCL Technologies**, I worked on enterprise-grade ETL workflows,
processing **20M+ records**, automating pipelines, and improving system throughput
and reliability. My academic and personal work extends this foundation into
**machine learning systems, reinforcement learning, and real-time applications**.

I approach engineering with a **systems mindset** — focusing on clarity,
maintainability, performance, and measurable impact.
